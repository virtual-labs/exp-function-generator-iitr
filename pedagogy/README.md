#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
This experiment contains the circuit of function generator using an op-amp. Firstly, student will make proper connections in the circuit to design a function generator using an operational amplifier. If the circuit is properly connected then the student will observe the plot for all waveforms (square, triangular or sine wave) at the output. Students can also check the effect of variation of amplitude, frequency, and phase on output waveforms.
